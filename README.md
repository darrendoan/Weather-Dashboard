# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
This weather dashboard is a simple application where we were required to apply our knowledge on server side APIs, local storage, basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The application allows the user to search any city in the world to view its current forecast and the forecast over the next five days. It works by searching a city in the search bar, then by clicking search or pressing the 'enter' key, the current forecast and the predictied forecast over the next five days of that city pops up. Additionally, if for whatever reason you are lost and/or have forgotten where you were last, you can use the Current Location button to find out which city you are in.

The application displays following weather variables:
- City name
- Current date and the next five days' date
- Temperature in Â°C
- Wind in KMH
- Humidity in %
- Weather Icon

When a city is searched, the name of that city is then displayed under Recent Searches, allowing you to click on any city there, showing you the current weather and the weather oer the next 5 days of that chosen city. 

The application was creating as a homework challenge from the USYD Coding Bootcamp. Below is the user story and acceptance criteria demonstrating its requirements.
